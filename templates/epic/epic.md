# Epic Name

## Vision
What is this epic about? What problem does it solve? One paragraph.

## Decisions
<!-- Populated during planning. Each decision should be specific enough to generate a test. -->

## Dependency Graph
<!-- Show which stories can run in parallel and which are blocked -->
<!-- Example:
```
01-api ──────┬──► 04-frontend ──► 06-launch
02-emails ───┤
03-design ───┘   05-integration ─┘

Parallel groups:
- Group 1: 01, 02, 03 (no dependencies)
- Group 2: 04, 05 (after group 1)
- Group 3: 06 (after all)
```
-->

## Context Files
<!-- Key files in the codebase that this epic touches -->

## Notes
<!-- Anything else the agent should know -->
