# Backlog

Epics here are ideas waiting to be planned.

## What This Folder Is
A parking lot for future work. Epics here have a rough vision but haven't been specced into stories yet.

## What You Can Do Here
- Read epics to understand the roadmap
- Help prioritize if asked
- Move an epic to `planning/` when the human says to start planning it

## What You Cannot Do
- Do NOT start planning without being asked
- Do NOT move epics to `active/` — they must go through `planning/` first
- Do NOT implement anything

## Moving to Planning
When the human greenlights an epic for planning:
```bash
mv backlog/{epic-name} planning/
```

Then enter `planning/{epic-name}` and follow the planning CLAUDE.md.
