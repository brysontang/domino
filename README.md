  Set up the dominos. Push them over.

## Setup

Open Claude Code in your project and paste:

```
Clone https://github.com/brysontang/domino.git into this project, then read domino/setup/CLAUDE.md and follow the instructions
```

## How It Works

1. **Create an epic** — "Create an epic for user authentication"
2. **Define stories** — Claude helps you break it into pieces
3. **Resolve ambiguities** — Claude asks questions until requirements are crystal clear
4. **Push** — "Start working on the auth epic"

Claude reads the instructions in each folder and does the rest. You watch the dominos fall.

## Note

The templates mention Codex for code review. If you don't have Codex, tell Claude to update the CLAUDE.md files to use a review subagent instead.
